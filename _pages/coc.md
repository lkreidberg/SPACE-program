title: Code of Conduct
---

We are committed to providing a strong and
enforced code of conduct and expect everyone on the SPACE team to follow these
guidelines when interacting with others in all forums. Our goal is to keep ours
a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community. 


Our team is made up of members from
around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
It is through these differences that our community experiences success and
continued growth. As members of this community:

1. We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
2. We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
3. We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to junior members of the team. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback on work done as part of the SPACE Program.
4. We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our team and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.
5. We pledge to help the entire team follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. 
 
**This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.**

**Reporting**: Please report any violations of the Code of Conduct to the SPACE Program co-PIs, Laura Kreidberg and Drake Deming. In conjunction with the SPACE Science Council, they will clarify and enforce standards of acceptable behavior and take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. All community members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

**Enforcement**: We follow the enforcement guidelines of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). 

Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the Astropy, NumFOCUS, and MPIA GitHub codes of conduct:
